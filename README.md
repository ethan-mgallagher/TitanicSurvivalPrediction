# TitanicSurvivalPrediction

Using data to predict survival from the Titanic disaster.

To view this project's code, data visualizations, and results, simply open the TitanicSurvivalPrediction notebook by clicking 
on TitanicSurvivalPrediction.ipynb. This should be able to open the project's Jupyter Notebook in the browser. Sometimes this 
does not work properly, however, in which case an anaconda3 environment will be necessary to clone and run this notebook.
